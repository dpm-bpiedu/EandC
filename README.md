### Branch phase1

In phase 1, Blaine's design was modified to account for notes and highlights and to allow for keyboard access. WAI-ARIA specifications for "disclosures" have been used. A "learn more" button toggles show/hide. A close button hides. All markup is hardcoded into the html.

In phase 2, we'll try to have some markup such as buttons and aria attributes added dynamically on page load, instead of hardcoded.

In phase 3, we'll try to regulate behavior depending on screen size.

#### Files

0.0-test.css is Blaine's base design
