    <p class="tx">But yesterday&rsquo;s approaches to education do not work well for the school&rsquo;s new
      mission, or for today&rsquo;s students, argues Prensky (2011; 2012a; 2012b). Today&rsquo;s learners are very
      different learners: They are members of what is sometimes labeled the <strong>net generation</strong>;
      Oblinger &amp; Oblinger, 2005) (or the <em>Z generation</em>, the <em>iGen</em>, the <em>post-millennials</em>,
      or any of a variety of other competing labels). Basically, these are learners so profoundly influenced by
      digital technologies such as the Internet, video games, and computers that they think and learn differently
      from older generations of students. (We look at some characteristics of today&rsquo;s learners and at their
      impact on learning and assessment in Chapter 3).</p>

    <p class="tx">Because today&rsquo;s learner is different, and because what we expect of our schools is also
      different, contemporary emphases are changing. They reflect our beliefs and intentions regarding the main
      purpose of schools. Today&rsquo;s model is more egalitarian: It advocates success for all rather than success
      for the chosen few. Furthermore, educators such as Prensky (2016) argue strongly that education for the
      future should be less about improving individuals than about improving the world. In his words, &ldquo;Kids
      now need an education that is far more connected and real than in the past&mdash;an education that gives them
      not only knowledge, but also provides them with empowerment and agency&rdquo; (p. 1). Accordingly,
      today&rsquo;s teacher views assessment mainly as a tool to provide guidance and assistance&mdash;a tool
      designed to make today&rsquo;s student a highly competent, self-motivated, life-long learner. The hope is
      that this learner will also be imbued with the motivation and passion to make the world a better place.</p>

      <p>You have been subjected to assessments of one kind or another all your life. In all likelihood,
        within a few minutes of being born, a nurse or attending physician gave you the well-known <strong>Apgar test</strong>&mdash;a
        test which assessed your general <strong>a</strong>ppearance (blue or pink), your <strong>p</strong>ulse (heart
        rate), your <strong>g</strong>rimace (reflexive reactions such as coughing, sneezing, crying, or, yes,
        grimacing), your <strong>a</strong>ctivity level (muscle tone described as limp, weak, or strong), and your <strong>r</strong>espiration.</p>

          &ldquo;poor.&rdquo; Incidentally, over 90 percent of U.S. infants score 9 or 10, and fewer than 0.5 percent
          score below 4 (Fei et al., 2013). Had your score been zero on this first test, you would in all likelihood
